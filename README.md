# TF2-Easy-Config
Team Fortress 2's default settings suck. This attempts to make fixing that easier.
Includes fixes of: Narrow fov, overly large viewmodels, and unappealing network settings.
# How to use
To use you simply download the .exe and run it, then choose what settings you'd like (I recommend the default changes) and after that you're all done and may delete the configurator.
No installation required.
# It broke something!
If something breaks or you'd like to revert changes head to C:/Program Files (x86)Steam/Steamapps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf/cfg (default installation location) and delete or modify autoexec.cfg
